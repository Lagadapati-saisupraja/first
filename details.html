  'info-1': '<img src="andrew.jpg" alt="John Doe" id=hp><p>Anyone who lived in the San Marcos area over the past five years probably remembers the Iconic Village fire. The 2018 fire, started by an arsonist who has yet to be caught, killed five students and left many others injured and displaced from their homes. Senior Andrew Campbell lived through the fire shortly after graduating from Texas State and had to move back to Houston.</p><br><p>During his time at Texas State, Andrew was a part of the Honors College, Bobcat Build, and Pagan Student Fellowship all while working at Torchy’s Tacos. While his degree was in Biology, Andrew didn’t find what he really loved doing until a couple years after graduating. </p><br><p>Andrew grew up in Rhode Island and later the Houston area before going to Texas State to get his degree in Biology. He grew up homeschooled, which allowed him to complete community college credits and get ahead before even starting college</p><br><p>After spending a couple years in Houston after the Iconic Village fire, Andrew moved back to San Marcos to transition in a place he felt supported. He started working at the Hays County Food Bank, a place where he spent time volunteering in the past. </p><br><p>Andrew is now the Volunteer and Client Services Coordinator and helps organize volunteers, check people in at food distributions, and connect people with community resources. As someone who had to pay his way through college, Andrew knows what it’s like to need additional resources. His past experience has made him a great resource for people in the San Marcos community.</p><br><p>“That year was pretty all over the place,” Andrew said.</p>',
      'info-2': '<img src="a2.jpg" alt="Jane Smith" id=hp><p>Texas native Shelby Galvin went from an FFA enthusiast to working at Netflix in Hollywood. Shelby is originally from Dallas, but her dad was in the Army and they moved around a lot. When she toured Texas State in high school, she fell in love with the campus and decided to stay in Texas for college.</p><br><p>Shelby started out with a degree in PR and Journalism but after interning at the Texas Capitol, she decided to switch to Finance. While at Texas State, she was the director of Paws Preview and a member of Gamma Phi Beta. She was a part of the Housley Principled Leadership class and eventually got to intern and help write curriculum.</p><br><p>“I learned so much from the folks I worked with in these programs,” Shelby said. “I attribute a lot of my success today from what I learned there”</p><br><p>Shelby loved her education and professional experiences, but she also loved to spend time out with friends. Her favorite spot was The Green Parrot for $2 “You Call Its” on Tuesdays.</p><br><p>After graduating in 2014, Shelby got a job at a small consulting firm in Austin. She was lucky enough to work on a project with Netflix, and they offered her a job after the project was finished. Now, Shelby leads a team that develops budgeting tools for Netflix.</p><br><p>Shelby decided to give back to her Texas State community and start a scholarship for women in STEM. She has a passion for “fintech,” which is a combination of finance and technology. She wants to help women become leaders in this field.</p><br><p>Shelby’s taking action on this promise by awarding a $5,000 scholarship through the Stelos Alliance. The Durrenberger Scholarship for Women in Science awards scholarships to undergraduate or graduate students majoring in any of the programs/departments (Biology, Chemistry/Biochemistry, Physics, Computer Science, Mathematics Engineering Technology, Engineering, Material Science, Engineering and Commercialization Program) in the College of Science & Engineering with a preference for female students.  </p>',
      'info-3':'<img src="a3.jpg" alt="Jane Smith" id=hp><p>Vanessa Cortez Tanner grew up watching the news. For most kids, the news channel was a boring interlude parents put on between cartoons. Vanessa wasn’t like most kids. </p><br><p>Throughout childhood and into college, Vanessa started learning about politics and developed a passion for policy. Now she serves as the Chief of Staff for the Texas House of Representatives.</p><br><p>Vanessa’s mother immigrated to the US from Mexico when she was just 11 years old and started a life near the Gulf in Harlingen, Texas. As an only child, Vanessa was close to her parents and got all the attention from them. </p><br><p>“It was never in the cards for me to leave the valley,” Vanessa said. “My parents really didn’t want me to go away to college”</p><br><p>Vanessa applied to Texas State and got in as a first generation college student. She studied hard and focused on academics, but eventually she started to get lonely.</p><br><p>Vanessa’s mother immigrated to the US from Mexico when she was just 11 years old and started a life near the Gulf in Harlingen, Texas.

      'info-4':'<img src="a4.jpg" alt="Jane Smith" id=hp><p>When Craig Soudelier enrolled Texas State, he probably never imagined he would end up living in 5 different countries and working in multiple industries. He was the first and only member of his family to finish college.  Now, Craig is an entrepreneur who has started and sold multiple businesses. </p><br><p>While at Texas State, Craig was on the executive board of Phi Delta Theta, a member of the Student Foundation and a member of Order of Omega. He stayed busy paying his way through college until he graduated in 1991 with a Bachelor’s in Computer Science.</p><br><p>After graduating, Craig fixed and sold computers for three years at the largest Mac reseller in the world. Over the next 10 years, he worked in Operations and Sales until he got pulled into Human Resources.</p><br><p>In those years, Craig was able to travel the world. He moved to France for 6 months, Malaysia for a couple years, Hong Kong, and finally Singapore. In 2006, Craig left the company to start his own business in Houston where he could be close to his family.</p><br><p>“I got to be home for their birthdays for the first time,” Craig said.</p><br><p>He eventually sold that business and started a staffing agency in 2012. After the agency became successful, he sold it as well and decided to consult and volunteer for a while. He coached little league, was on the board of Young Life and active in the Church. He’s now the Chairman for the Cy-Fair Chamber of Commerce in Houston, working with small businesses and helping them achieve their goals.</p><br><p>“I spend more of my time on civic duty than professional duty,” Craig said.</p><br><p>Today Craig spends his time working as the Human Resources Director for ABA Therapy For Life, a program that provides life changing Autism services. </p>',
      'info-5':'<img src="a5.jpg" alt="Jane Smith" id=hp><p>Marguerite “Maggie” Miller was only 17 when she moved away from home and began her undergraduate career at Texas State. She worked two jobs to support herself and pay for school, going to classes in the morning, nannying through the day and waitressing at night at a local Italian Restaurant, Italian Garden. This obviously left little time to focus on academics or extracurriculars. </p><br><p>Maggie enrolled in the Housley Principled Leadership course, which was when she started to think about her future career. She was especially inspired by Kevin Housley, the man who the course was inspired by and dedicated to. </p><br><p>“Kevin Housley himself was both a rancher and a businessman,” Maggie said. “That was how I grew up and what I wanted to accomplish.”</p><br><p>Growing up in Blanco, Texas on a ranch and in a low-income household, Maggie didn’t know white collar careers were an option for her. They seemed out of reach. When she met her now-husband who grew up in California, her father-in-law remarked that her goals could be bigger, and that instead of hoping to become a paralegal at the law firm she was an assistant at, she should reach higher and get a law degree.</p><br><p>Initially, her reaction was that this wasnt a viable option, thinking “that’s not a real thing, that’s something that people from my background only accomplish in the movies.”</p><br><p>But Maggie was interested in learning more. She did her research, took the LSAT, and was accepted to many schools across the country, eventually deciding on Seattle University. Maggie has now finished law school. She passed the Washington bar exam this summer and is now a practicing attorney in Seattle at Carney Badley Spellman, P.S. She focuses on the startup community, corporate transactions, and privacy issues</p><br><p>“I find startup work really fun,” Maggie said. “A lot of the time it’s a puzzle, and you’re helping someone make their dream come true.”</p><br><p>Now that she has achieved what she didn’t think was possible, she wants to mentor the next generation, including law students from low socioeconomic backgrounds like her.</p>'
