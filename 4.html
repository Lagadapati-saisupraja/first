<p style="font-size: 30px;">Jennifer Furr, Senior Director of Alumni and University Relations and mastermind of the show recently commented, “Each year we explore different ways to reconnect with our alumni especially at Homecoming. The idea of connecting with those who graduated from our Art Department program has been on my radar for a number of years. In discussing with Professor Bockelman ways to engage these former students it was obvious that an Art Show would provide a great way to reconnect but also lift up the unbelievable talent our alumni possess. I have been overwhelmed by the response of artwork coming in for the show and the enthusiasm from alumni young and old around their support of the Art Department and faculty. I look forward to seeing the exhibit and sharing with others how talented our Concordia alumni are.”</p>
<p style="font-size: 30px;">For this show, each alumnus submitted a work that fits the dimensions of 12” X 12”. All mediums will be featured including photography, sculpture, painting, drawing, printmaking, graphic design, and mixed media.</p>
<p style="font-size: 30px;">James Bockelman, the director of the Marxhausen Gallery of Art stated, “It’s wonderful to see a tremendous response so far. And particularly, the diversity of art and artifacts that people have sent to the gallery, all of which remind me of their ongoing commitment to the significance of art in its variety of expression”.  </p>
<p style="font-size: 30px;">Homecoming weekend is Friday, October 1 and Saturday, October 2. There will be opportunities to take a tour of the Brommer Art Center, visit the Marxhausen Gallery of Art, connect with emeriti and current faculty members, as well as reconnect with classmates.</p>
