    <p style="font-size:20px;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;margin-left:130px;margin-right: 120px;"><strong style="font-size:23px;">Why Virtual Alumni Events?</strong><br>
        Without a doubt, alumni engagement is vital for inculcating a sense of community, securing donations, and strengthening your institute’s brand presence.
        
        With the second wave of infection raging across the world, you can expect more event cancelations. Virtual eventscan thus help alumni adjust to the new normal.
        
        Given such unforeseen circumstances, you need to adopt a new digital engagement strategy for alumni.
        
        Here’s why:
        
        <br><strong style="font-size:23px;">Encouraging Support and Contribution</strong>
        The pandemic has been tough for universities and alumni alike. Besides rapidly adopting the online learning format, colleges had to ensure continued contributions amidst the viral outbreak.
        
        A major part of the monetary support comes from alumni associations. When alumni find their network to be highly valuable, they are likely to give back more than what they had in mind previously.
        
        Did you know that the alumni giving rate is a crucial metric of success?
        
        Yes, as a matter of fact, your university can rank higher with alumni donations. For instance, Princeton University is among the top-ranked universities in the United States. The alumni giving rate in Princeton is an incredible 59%.
        
        Since the conventional get-togethers are no longer feasible, the virtual alumni events can prove to be a boon for your fiscal security. You just have to ensure that the virtual events for college alumni offer great professional and social value for alma maters.
        
        Consequently, with the help of virtual alumni reunion, you can enhance the prestige and ratings of your university.
        
        <br><strong style="font-size:23px;">Offering Networking Opportunities with Virtual Alumni Events</strong>
        As you may already know that the unemployment rate has skyrocketed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Hence, people are seeking new job opportunities. Unfortunately, the job hunt has become more challenging than ever due to the global economic crisis.
        
        In that case, alumni offices can organize online alumni events that could serve as valuable networking opportunities. Besides, alumni get to interact with their community during these tough times further strengthening the relations. 
        <br><strong style="font-size:23px;">AlmaShines Alumni Platform</strong>
